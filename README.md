# Deep-Learning-in-Python
The repo is built for recording my journal on Deep Learning. 
I got completed concepts about Deep Learning, and also implemented various kinds of algorithms including MLP, Autoencoder ,RNN, GRU, LSTM. 
The frameworks I use in this project include tensorflow and theano.<br>

The turorials which I studied is created by Lazy programmer team.
